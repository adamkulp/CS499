Serpent


RUNNING THE APPLICATION:

The python 3 installer package must be downloaded and installed from the official website.
To activate the proper Pygame library please run the following command in the python terminal
"pip3 install pygame"

At this point the file can now be ran just as any other python script or py file would be
(python3 serpent\ Game.py)

Game Play:

W- moves the snake in an upward position
A- moves the snake in a left position
S- moves the snake in a downward position
D- moves the snake in a right position

Object:

control the snake in a manner as to collect all apples as they appear. This will in turn cause the snake to become larger
and your personal score to increase. The game will be over when either the snake reaches the out of bounds (edge of screen)
area or the snake becomes so large that it collides with itself.

Note:

If the setting is too difficult, setting can be changed within the code along with other settings such as foreground and 
background color as well as snake color etc. as you see fit.
