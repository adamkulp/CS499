PURPOSE: display filtered animal information based on userâ€™s needs. In this particular instance 
the program was being created for a company called Grazioso Salvare which finds and adopts animals 
to train for various purposes. This particular project contained data for a myriad of different animal 
types but dogs were the focus for the project. This data could be sorted based on breed, color, type 
etc but buttons were also built in that would auto sort for specific animals that were considered 
to be premier rescue animals as per the project guidelines. This project would also utilize the 
data within the database to display a map and pie chart for the data. The main purpose of the project
was to create a program for Grazioso Salvare that could utilize shelter data in an effort to easily
look for and obtain shelter animals that would be great at rescue training.
